# Zenodo deposit — Paper 3

Paste-ready. Files to upload are listed at the bottom.

**Order:** satisfied. Paper 1 (`10.5281/zenodo.22863946`) and Paper 2
(`10.5281/zenodo.22865343`) are both deposited, and both companion citations
in this manuscript now carry their DOIs. This record can be minted.

**Audits done.** Two independent non-computational audits were run on
2026-09-20 (reports in `audit_2026-09-20/`). The first returned MAJOR REVISION
with four blockers, including a false equivalence between the paper's
triple-completion labelling and Kummer degree collapse; that claim is
withdrawn and replaced by the actual conductor-divisibility condition, with
counterexamples in both directions now in the text. The second returned MINOR
REVISION with no blockers, and caught four places where pre-revision language
had survived the first round of fixes. All findings are addressed.

## Description

Paste the manuscript abstract, then add:

> The same-prime pair and triple exclusion laws are proved unconditionally and
> machine-checked in Lean 4; the general translation of the barring condition
> into residue classes is carried out by hand per instance rather than
> formalised generically. The density comparisons rest on the
> Matthews–Moree–Stevenhagen framework and are conditional on GRH. The census
> programs are deterministic integer tallies and have been re-run on
> independent hardware, reproducing the stored results byte-for-byte.

### Do NOT upload

- `submission/crossbase_artin_anonymous.pdf` — blinded copy is for journal peer
  review; a Zenodo deposit is attributed.
- `backups/`, `archive/` — working material and superseded drafts.
- `audit_2026-09-11/` — optional. Honest and reflects well, but it is internal
  review correspondence; include only if you want the review history public.
